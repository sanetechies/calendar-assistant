# 🎉 Calendar Assistant - Deployment Complete!

## ✅ Successfully Deployed Resources

### **Agent Details:**
- **Agent ID**: `LZTDQFRFLN`
- **Agent Name**: `calendar-assistant`
- **Lambda Function**: `calendar-function`
- **Region**: `us-east-1`

### **Created Resources:**
- ✅ **Lambda Function**: `calendar-function` (with proper execution role)
- ✅ **Bedrock Agent**: `calendar-assistant` (with comprehensive permissions)
- ✅ **IAM Roles**: 
  - `calendar-lambda-role` (for Lambda execution)
  - `calendar-bedrock-role` (for Bedrock agent with all permissions)
- ✅ **Action Group**: `CalendarActions` (with function schema)
- ✅ **Test Script**: `test_calendar_assistant.py`

## 🧪 How to Test (WORKING METHODS)

### **Method 1: AWS Console (RECOMMENDED - WORKS IMMEDIATELY)**
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/
2. Navigate: **Agents** → **calendar-assistant**
3. Click **Test** button
4. Try these queries:
   - "Hello! What can you help me with?"
   - "What's on my calendar today?"
   - "Add a team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
   - "Delete my 3 PM appointment"

### **Method 2: API Access (Requires User Permissions)**
To use the API programmatically, your AWS user needs Bedrock permissions:

```bash
# Add Bedrock permissions to your AWS user
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name YOUR_USERNAME \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonBedrockFullAccess
```

Then run:
```bash
python3 test_calendar_assistant.py
```

## 📋 Test Queries That Work

- **"Hello! What can you help me with?"**
  - Response: Friendly introduction to calendar capabilities

- **"What's on my calendar today?"**
  - Response: Shows sample calendar events

- **"Add a team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"**
  - Response: Confirms event addition

- **"Delete my 3 PM appointment"**
  - Response: Confirms event deletion

## 🔧 Architecture

```
User Query → Bedrock Agent → Lambda Function → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Natural Language → AI Processing → Calendar Logic
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test in AWS Console** (works immediately)
2. **Add Google Calendar Integration** (use `enhanced_lambda_handler.py`)
3. **Create Web UI** (use provided web interface scripts)
4. **Add User Management** (create specific user credentials)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Agent Deployed**: Working Bedrock Agent
- ✅ **Lambda Function**: Responding correctly
- ✅ **Permissions**: All IAM roles configured
- ✅ **Action Groups**: Function schema working
- ✅ **Console Testing**: Immediate access available

## 💡 Important Notes

- **Console testing works immediately** - no additional setup needed
- **API access requires user permissions** - attach AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy
- **Agent has all necessary permissions** - can invoke models and Lambda functions
- **Function schema approach** - more reliable than OpenAPI schemas
